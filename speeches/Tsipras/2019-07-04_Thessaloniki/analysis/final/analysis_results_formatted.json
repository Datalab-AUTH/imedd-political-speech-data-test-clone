{"text": "   Citizens of Thessaloniki, I bring you a single message from my tours throughout Greece. \n&&&\n From Crete, the Dodecanese, Florina, Kavala, Tripoli, Patras, I bring you one message. Subversion is not just a need for the great social majority. It has already begun.  I see it in people's eyes, in people's passion, in people's stubbornness, in the determination with which we fight the difficult battle. I see it today, here in Thessaloniki, in your faces. \n&&&\n I see it and I know it, because this is a different battle. On Sunday we are voting for our lives, and so let us not take this ballot box for granted. Let some people not be in a hurry to prejudge the outcome. The Greek people have not yet said their last word. \n&&&\n Let the princes not be in a hurry, and let them not think that they will return to their thrones. It is the Greek people who will decide who and with whom they want to move forward in the next four years.  We say every day and every hour that we must and can win this election. Our people must win, and can win this crucial battle. \n&&&\n Not for Syriza, but for Greece. Not for the party, but for our lives. The young people, the pensioners, the small and medium-sized businesses, the intellectuals, all those who look forward to a better tomorrow need it. At the bottom of the IMF, the memoranda and the restoration of the old political establishment that bankrupted us. Which bankrupted us and which now demands what. It's asking us to take back the keys to the country. And first and foremost to take back the keys to the treasury. Those who bankrupted and plundered the fund, those who handed it over empty, are now asking to snatch the labours and sacrifices of the Greek people. They are asking to take the more than 35 billion from the sacrifices of our people and give it to the banks and the bankers. In other words, to those who led us into the crisis.  And I ask you, will the Greek people leave their efforts and sacrifices to those who led them into bankruptcy. \n&&&\n Will they give back the keys to the fund to those who ruined it. The Greek people have both memory and judgment. And above all, the Greek people know about reversals. \n&&&\n And now, yes, I believe it, we all believe it, it will achieve the greatest political and electoral upheaval in the modern history of the country.     But, citizens of Thessaloniki, a ghost is hovering over the country these hours. The ghost of those responsible for the economic, political and moral bankruptcy of the country. The political staff of bankruptcy, the media barons, and the lords of the interconnection. All of them, after having led Greece to the precipice, after having emptied the coffers, with the interconnection, corruption, bribery, and payrolls.  The people cannot forget who are the ones who bankrupted the country. Who are the ones who plundered the country. Who are the ones who shattered its hopes and dreams for so many years. And they are the same unrepentant ones who want to come back and want to come back to continue their destructive work.      After the coffers are empty. After they ran away, leaving behind wreckage and a deficit of over 24 billion. \n&&&\n After the others, when they landed bumpily from the fantasy world of 'money is there', ran begging to carry the IMF hawks here. After failing to deal, with three successive governments, with the suffering they themselves caused. After they ended up in the end shouting \"Geroun solid\" and terrorizing with Grexit, blackmailing the Greek government, together with the cruelest of the lenders, for its NO to blackmail. \n&&&\n After filling the country with padlocks, blowing unemployment to unprecedented heights, they have devastated a quarter of the economy. Now what are they doing. Now they are wagging their finger at us. And they tell us that the country we rescued from the abyss they threw it into belongs to them. \n&&&\n  Do you know something citizens of Thessaloniki. They do not forgive us. And why don't they forgive us. They don't forgive us because we succeeded where they failed with three successive governments. They do not forgive us because we finally got the country out of the memoranda. They do not forgive us because we did this while taking care of the weakest. \n&&&\n The wage earners, the small and medium-sized enterprises, the young, the pensioners. They do not forgive us because, in the most difficult circumstances, we resisted cruelty by putting people, solidarity, universal human values and humanity above all else. Whether it was millions of our compatriots, or thousands of refugees facing the biggest refugee crisis since the Second World War. These things are not forgiven. They do not forgive us because we have spoiled their plans to turn the memoranda into a regime in which the few prosper on the backs of the many. And finally, they do not forgive us for one more thing.        These things are not forgiven. They don't forgive us for that. \n&&&\n Well, then, let them not forgive us. To us their slanders are praise. It is praise for the toxic attacks of big media with blood and money ties to them. For us, attacks and hospitality are praise, like the day before yesterday when I decided to fight the battle of SKY, because Mr Mitsotakis himself never came to confront me and I decided to go to his court. It is praise for us that this reception. It is praise for us that these attacks have taken place. \n&&&\n It is praise for us the threats, supposedly, of our strategic crushing, the threats of persecution and institutional bans. And let them be sure. They are not going to bring us to our knees. They are not going to get rid of the left, the democratic party of the country, so easily. They are not going to get off so easily with us. \n&&&\n But neither are they going to change our minds.       The Left, citizens of Thessaloniki, the democratic and progressive party in our country, have too deep roots in the people and in history to fear the reactionary assault that is being attempted today. And I say this, especially here in Thessaloniki. In the Thessaloniki of Lambrakis, of Tsarouxas, of Chalkidis, of Moskov. In the Thessaloniki of poets and struggles. Thessaloniki has not only read the book of democracy, it has written the book of democracy in our country. \n&&&\n So let them hear it well.  The world of labour and the generations of democracy and progress, all generations, will not allow this restoration that is now being attempted. They are not going to allow the return of the great majority of our people to insecurity and the labour jungle. But, citizens of Thessaloniki, because we are in the period of great speeches and great promises, all that they have done and are doing these days is extremely instructive. We must not forget them.         Because, you know, one's work shows what one's words hide. \n&&&\n Everybody's work and identity. They make today's growth not just strong, but dizzying. But they are the same people who led Greece to the greatest underdevelopment the country has ever seen in peacetime. The loss of 25% of our national wealth in just a few years. And it is we, who have managed for nine consecutive quarters now, to keep our economy growing at a positive rate. \n&&&\n       They provide lots of good jobs. But they are the ones who have caused the working class to bleed, pushing unemployment to 28% and for our young people to 60%. They are the ones who overnight cut the minimum wage by 22%. And they introduced the racist sub-minimum for young workers. They are the ones who abolished collective bargaining, depriving workers of the basic right to negotiate and fight, that is, for the conditions and pay of their work. And it is we who, as soon as we came out of the memoranda, restored collective bargaining, raised the minimum wage by 11% and abolished the shameful sub-minimum wage for young people. And it is they, we, who committed to a 15% increase in the minimum wage over the next two years to bring wages back to pre-crisis levels.      They also provide decent pensions. \n&&&\n Who. The ones who slaughtered pensions by throwing hundreds of thousands of working people into despair. And it is we, who fought the hard battle with the lenders to keep pensions from being cut, who went against the grain and succeeded in cancelling the cuts. It's us who gave pensioners a dividend every year. \n&&&\n We are the ones who introduced this year, as a permanent Easter gift as the 13th pension for pensioners.       Finally, the citizens of Thessaloniki are giving tax breaks to the middle class. But they are the ones who led to three hundred thousand locks in the market. It is they who have thrown wage earners and pensioners into poverty and insecurity, and imposed all kinds of taxes on professionals. It is they who humiliated the middle class, handed it over to the lenders with the assurance, remember then, that the middle class 'has fat' and deprived it of even the most basic things. And it is we who, having just taken the noose from our throats, the noose of the memorandum, have introduced the first significant tax relief measures for the middle class in many years. It is we who have placed it, along with labour, at the heart of our concept and plan for growth. \n&&&\n      Because, let's know. No matter what their propaganda sirens say, when they talk about strong growth, they mean one thing and one thing only: Not strong growth, but growth for the strong. For the strong and only for the strong. The middle class was and is for them the underbelly that removes the sins of a socially unjust system, and ensures the great gains of the powerful. The middle class is for them, the one that always pays the price of their crisis. It is the middle class that will be the one who will pay the price again if we allow those who have sunk the country. \n&&&\n If we allow those who bankrupted the country to come back, to take over the management, the government of the country.      Citizens of Thessaloniki, the gap between the fine words and bad deeds of the New Democracy and Mr Mitsotakis is unfortunately not limited to economic issues. You know. You have often experienced it in a very brutal way here in your city. Here in Thessaloniki, in the capital of our Macedonia, but also in other cities in Macedonia, an incredible campaign of consciousness alteration has unfortunately unfolded over the last year. A miserable campaign of ethnic hatred and unspeakable hypocrisy. A campaign to exploit the patriotic feelings of our people. An attempt to poison and divide the Greek people. Because, you know, there is nothing to hide under the sun, even if they have been trying to hide all this under the sun of Vergina for so many years. \n&&&\n The latest revelations have come to expose the true face of everyone.  To show who is truly patriotic, and who is willing to bear even the temporary political cost to serve the country, and who exploits even the patriotism of the Greeks for electoral reasons.       We, with great effort, with great courage and long negotiations, have secured an agreement of which every Greek should be proud. \n&&&\n Because with this agreement we have secured not only the composite name for all, but above all the elimination of irredentism.  The most formal acceptance by all of the Greekness of ancient Macedonia. Statues that challenged this truth in the neighbouring country were torn down. \n&&&\n Signs with names of streets and public places that insulted this truth were torn down. North Macedonia's constitution was changed, and their textbooks too. As a result, today we have on our northern border a friend, an ally, not an enemy.  Today, it is our warplanes, not the Turkish ones, that protect their airspace. Today, it is our army that theirs is cooperating with, not the Turkish army. Today, in the climate of friendship that is being promoted throughout the Balkans, Thessaloniki once again has the great historic opportunity to become the economic, commercial and cultural capital of all the Balkans. \n&&&\n And our Macedonia, to escape from the status of an enclosed region and to hegemonize peacefully in the Balkans.  That, in a nutshell, is what we have achieved.       But really, what have they been doing all these years. \n&&&\n And what have they been doing lately. They have invested for months in a nationalism in need of enemies and traitors. They raged with a propaganda that took us back decades, branding, all of us, all of you - all of you who had a different opinion - as traitors, and minority. It even came to the point where Mr Mitsotakis publicly claims, even today, without a trace of shame, that we exchanged Macedonia for pensions. \n&&&\n And all this while they knew and know their own deeds and their own days.  All this, while they knew and know that since 2005, in the most humiliating way, they had handed over the name of Macedonia to the neighbours. They had accepted with letters to the President of America, to all European leaders, not only their constitutional name as the Republic of Macedonia. \n&&&\n Not only with this name they could be recognized internationally. But, they had also accepted, and no change to their constitution, no change to the challenge to appear internationally as the descendants of Alexander the Great, no provision to deal with this toxic irredentism.  All this, citizens of Thessaloniki, Mr Mitsotakis knew all this well. But he was pretending to be an indignant Macedonian gladiator. And today he pretends to be a Chinese. \n&&&\n He pretends not to have understood anything. But you know what, we knew all this too. We knew it, but we were negotiating, at the time, trying to undo for the benefit of the country their own concessions. \n&&&\n They had ridden the Bucephalus and they were fooling people. But just to show you who thinks and acts nationally, patriotically and not partisanly: we who knew all this did not say a word, we never spoke, although we were receiving a barrage of accusations and insults.  We did not speak out, even when we were scorned by the perpetrators of these retreats. \n&&&\n Why. Because we understood that this would be bad for the negotiation. Because we understood that it would harm the interests of the country, no matter how much it would benefit the government's interests in the internal debate. We have not spoken, Mr Mitsotakis, for so long, because we love Greece, with dedication, seriousness, selflessness, with sacrifice, if necessary.      The party of democracy and progress, the Left of resistance and struggle, has proved this many times in the course of history. We have always put patriotic interests above party interests. From the Venizelos years, from the epic of the 1940s and the years of the EAM to the present day, the Left, the Democratic Party, has put Greece first. So we too, true to the traditions we represent, put the interests of Greece first. And we are proud that through our efforts we have made our country stronger, stronger in the Balkans, in the Eastern Mediterranean, in Europe. \n&&&\n Everyone should recognize the prestige, the credibility of our country.      But Greece, despite the great strides that have been made over the years, is now at a critical crossroads. Our life is at a critical crossroads. \n&&&\n And the crucial question is: Are we all going to move forward together or are we going to turn back. Will we continue forward to a secure tomorrow for all citizens. Security for work, for rights, for equal opportunities. Protecting the weakest, investing in the young, supporting the hard-working. Fair development, from which everyone benefits according to their contribution. \n&&&\n Health, education, social protection for all. Or are we going back to the dark ages of insecurity. To the times of the surrender of life to speculation. To the times of surrendering our rights to the oligarchy. \n&&&\n Of surrendering democracy to authoritarianism and the police, and the country to the hawks of the IMF.      Some people say, citizens of Thessaloniki, that this is scaremongering. I am not scaremongering. I am warning. I am pointing out the danger. The danger is real. \n&&&\n This danger is here. Because no matter how much Mr Mitsotakis has been hiding in recent days and avoiding dialogue, avoiding the programmatic debate, even with half words, the truth has already been revealed. Even with half words, which are then refuted and then spoken again. Mr Mitsotakis, in this election period, without saying anything in particular, has said everything.          What does he want to do if elected. I wonder if he wants to cut taxes. \n&&&\n You failed. Wave of reforms first and then we'll see. Live to eat clover, May, the taxes. Reform wave. And what reforms are those. Reforms, he says, to get the thumbs up from the lenders and cut the surpluses. But we have already managed to reduce the surpluses since the 1920s, by depositing part of the sacrifices and efforts of the Greek people, 5.5 billion from the liquidity we managed to have in the public coffers. \n&&&\n No, he says. No, I don't agree with this plan. Reforms to lure them. What are these reforms. \n&&&\n They've been revealed one by one over the last few days.  Private education, private health care, private medical clinics of the NHS that will be equipped and manned by workers paid by the public, by the Greek taxpayer to provide private services. Seven days of work, for an unknown number of hours, since the eight-hour day is obsolete. \n&&&\n Outdated concepts of the past. Selling off the PPC, changing the contract for Elliniko, with provision for less green, and more concrete. Private supplementary insurance, black hole in pensions. \n&&&\n Increases in electricity and medicine. And the last one, the one that blew up the other day. A credit line, i.e. a new memorandum, and support for the banks with the billions raised by the sacrifices of our people.        So, I wonder, is there anything that in this election period, even if Mr Mitsotakis tried to hide with great effort, to hide, is there anything that he didn't say. Let no one say that he did not see. Let no one say that he did not listen. \n&&&\n Let no one say they don't know. With all this on the table, citizens of Thessaloniki, there are no more illusions about the plan that our political opponents have to return us to the dark days of the memorandum policies.       And since you are shouting this slogan of the 1980s, which was heard at the rallies of Andreas Papandreou's PASOK, allow me to address today the voters of today's PASOK. To all those who still believe in the ideas of Andreas Papandreou's PASOK, not in the current leadership of KINAL. To the people of a generation older than mine, the generation of the great struggles. To the generation of 114, the generation that lived through the apostasy. \n&&&\n To the generation of the later Polytechnic, and to the generation of the Change of the 1980s.  I would like to address this people, who, whatever the current leadership of Kinal says to them, they really believe this slogan. They really do not forget what the right means. And I want to ask them frankly: Really, what can you have to do with KINAL. Its President has said that she will again work with the Southwest. Its president said that she will give a tolerance vote to Mitsotakis. So if you all vote for KINAL today, you are giving a mandate to the right to govern. \n&&&\n And indeed, to an extreme and extreme neoliberal right.       So I ask you, sincerely, personally, to each and every one of you. I appeal to you, the voters of traditional PASOK, to reconsider. \n&&&\n And I call upon you all to move forward together. You too, to put a useful stone and a decisive step towards the great overthrow. Whereas a victory for the Southwest with one vote will mean restoration. It will mean the restoration of the most extreme version of the right. And it is a shame that this will happen with your tolerance or your support.       So we call on all progressives, all democratic citizens to join us in this great battle that we are fighting. \n&&&\n The great battle for the great electoral upset next Sunday. And I also want to appeal to all democrats, to patriots, to progressive citizens, to leftists and leftists of all shades and all generations. Those of us who have walked together, who have parted company at some point, but who are back on the streets of struggle, on the streets of assertion, on the streets of struggle. Because for us, listen, for us, it is not only crucial to hold up the banners of struggle and resistance, but it is also crucial not to escape from the fight to protect the interests of the social majority. \n&&&\n Not to run away, to fight the battle, even if you lose, even if you have defeats, even if you have wounds, to stand up and fight.      But I am addressing these people, the citizens of the Left of all generations and of all shades, who I know contributed decisively to the great miracle of 2015 and of January and September and July. And I address to all of us, despite our differences, an invitation to unity, struggle and fight for the great political upheaval.  Because now, citizens of Thessaloniki, some people tell us, you want a second chance. We answer them. It is the first chance to govern with our own programme, without orders, without pressure, without blackmail. \n&&&\n The first chance for the people, the Greek people, to see how a government of the Left, a progressive government, can govern without having its hands tied behind its back by the lenders. We say to them. We are not blaming you because you have high expectations. We have no problem, we just think that people should have expectations, high expectations, especially from us, from the left. But we say to them that the battle we have to fight now is a battle that concerns all of us.      Now the dilemma is not to express a message or not to express a message, to be reflected or not to be reflected in the ballot box. But the stakes are whether the country will be able to move forward, the working people, the great social majority will continue to see relief and support, or whether we will return to the dark days of plunder. And I also want to address all those who have had it drunk into their heads that Syriza has made a class choice, to support the weak and not the middle class. \n&&&\n And I want to address all of them, and I want to ask them. Really, what choice would you make if in your house one of your three children was weak. Wouldn't you take a plate of food from the other two to give to that weak one, to enable him to stand on his own two feet.  It was not a choice of class unilateralism. Because, yes, this was the IMF's plan, to lead Greece, like the other Balkan countries, to become 1/3 of the excluded and marginalised, 1/3 of the poor and plundered. This is what we have avoided all these years with great and difficult effort. \n&&&\n  And I want to address all of them and say. Really, when we supported the public hospitals with 19 thousand hires, when we abolished the 5 euro and gave free access to the uninsured, did we do that only for the weak. The middle classes, when their children get sick, their parents get sick, what hospitals do they go to. \n&&&\n Public or private.  Really, when we fought the battle to prop up a broken welfare state, by hiring in special education, in Help at Home, who were we doing it for. Only for the weak. When we managed to get public schools that opened in September but had teachers and books in December back to normal, who did we do that for. Only for the weak. \n&&&\n When we prevented the re-cutting of pensions and gave dignity to pensioners who saw cuts of up to 40% by the Samaras government, who did we do this for. For the weak and the weak alone.       Friends, citizens of Thessaloniki, we have both judgment and memory and the ability to compare and decide next Sunday. But we have also made mistakes... \n&&&\n but, you know, it is not only those who do not try who make mistakes, it is not only those who do not fight who make mistakes, it is not only those who do not fight who make mistakes. We, now, have the strength, the experience to correct our omissions and oversights, and to give material substance to visions of years and years.  This opportunity I am sure that Thessaloniki, first of all, will not let it go to waste. \n&&&\n I am sure that the rest of Greece will not let it go to waste either. In other words, to allow those who sent us to Caesarea to pretend to be saviours today.  Citizens of Thessaloniki, we have three crucial days ahead of us. \n&&&\n Friday, Saturday and Sunday. We have an important road ahead of us. Please know that what I am asking you and what I am asking you and what I am expressing my certainty that we can achieve is not the most impossible thing we have ever achieved. And we have achieved all these things.  So now I ask you to achieve the last impossible thing that will be possible, with your support, with your fight, with your vote. And I want you to keep in mind that the most beautiful struggles, and the most beautiful days for all of us, are ahead of us. We have not yet experienced the most beautiful days. It's just that what we've managed to do is to wash away the dirty laundry of the old political system, is to take the noose off our necks. The most beautiful days for our people are ahead of us, and we will live them together, we will create them together, we will claim them together. \n&&&\n It is up to us to move forward united, victorious. To hold our lives in our own hands.  So I invite you all, all of you, during these three days, tightly, together with the SYRIZA and Progressive Alliance ballot paper. \n&&&\n Not a minute wasted in these last hours. To leave no one alone on the road to the ballot box. To talk to the people, to convince the people, to fill the people with optimism and to fill the empty ballot box on Sunday morning with our own dreams, our own plans, our own will of optimism. Let us fill it with SYRIZA's ballot papers for the great electoral upheaval. \n&&&\n House by house, village by village, neighbourhood by neighbourhood, square by square, I ask you in these three days to believe it, to believe it and to convince one more of each of us. And the great upheaval will come. You can be sure of it. We will win. You can be sure of it.  It is worth it that this new generation is not another generation that will be told at some point that you will live worse than the previous ones. \n&&&\n This new generation with our own struggles to become the generation that will live in a better Greece, in a just Greece. We can. We can achieve it. Good strength and good fight . . .
