This is the state we want and this is the state we will have with the victory of New Democracy in the elections. That is precisely why from our first term of office, keep one thing in mind: consistency of words and deeds. It is the guarantee that as we have delivered what we promised, we will deliver what we want for tomorrow. We will have the opportunity to present our government's work in detail in two days. This New Democracy we are fighting for is the New Democracy that will fight for a productive and social Greece, for a digital and green Greece, for a fair and strong Greece.
