And alongside this state, with the Prime Minister's own building, the Maximou building, at its centre, the web of a dark parastate was created, with Predator and the surveillance of journalists, ministers, opponents of the government, even the leadership of the Armed Forces, an incredible abuse of any concept of the rule of law. And all this has been covered for months by the veil of supposed secrecy. And the judiciary is not concerned, and Mr Mitsotakis, who had this mechanism of the parastatal set up in his office, not only did not do what a prime minister would do in any other European country, not only did he not resign, not only did he not even feel the need to apologise, but he is also giving us lessons in democracy today.
